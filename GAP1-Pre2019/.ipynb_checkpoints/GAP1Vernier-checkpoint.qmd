# Curriculum Up to 2019

I have been strongly influenced by the *Modeling Physics* approach 
to teaching physics, and the physics education research of [Eugenia Etkina](https://gse.rutgers.edu/faculty/eugenia-etkina/) who developed the 
[ISLE](http://www.islephysics.net/) 
(Investigative Science Learning Environment) curriculum.
