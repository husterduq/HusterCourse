    "text": "I have always been drawn to hands-on science. I love designing and building gadgets, devices, and experiments. About ten years ago a remarkable development started happening: the Maker Movement. This movement was enabled and spurred on by the development of cheap, accessible microcontrollers. The first wildly popular one was the Arduino Uno.\nFor the first time non-specialists could build hardware and program the microcontrollers. The language was C++ and the Arduino people developed a simple IDE (Itegrated Development Environment).\nFrom this beginning, the movement exploded. Now microcontrollers are very fast and can be programmed in python, an interactive programming language that is very widely used in many industries."
