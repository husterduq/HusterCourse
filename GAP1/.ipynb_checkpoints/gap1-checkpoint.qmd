# PHYS 211L - GAP 1 Lab
GAP stands for **G**eneral **A**analytical **P**hysics. 
It is a calculus-based introductory physics course.

## Before 2020
Before AY (Academic Year) 2019-2020 I used 
[Vernier LabQuest2's](https://www.vernier.com/product/labquest-2/)
and various sensors for the lab. The materials for the last year 
I used the LabQuests is [here](../GAP1Vernier/GAP1Vernier.qmd)

# 2022 - Present
In response to the need to provide for remote instruction, I switched 
to the [iOLab](https://iolab.science). The materials for this course 
is in this folder.
