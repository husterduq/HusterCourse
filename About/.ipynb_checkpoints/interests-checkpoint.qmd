I have always been drawn to hands-on science. 
I love designing and building gadgets, devices, and experiments. 
About ten years ago a remarkable development started happening: 
the *Maker Movement*. This movement was enabled and spurred on by 
the development of cheap, accessible microcontrollers. The first 
wildly popular one was the Arduino Uno. 

For the first time non-specialists could build hardware and program 
the microcontrollers. The language was C++ and the Arduino people 
developed a simple IDE (**I**tegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment). 

From this beginning, the movement exploded. Now microcontrollers are 
very fast and can be programmed in python, an interactive programming 
language that is very widely used in many industries.
